Since we only have limited amount of time, I should decide what facility to support and not to...

 - this RDBMS only supports page size equals to block size. This can be lead to some restriction of facility and preformance.
   However, this will ease implementation of binary maintenance. With this restriction, writing and reading page at once does not cause any cost because after all a block of storage has to be read or write.
   This enable developer to use fancy libraries and structure supported by java library, which makes implementation easier and not trying to make the most efficiend RDBMS that I can implement.
   Since this project is to learn the implementation of RDBMS as whole, I hope this compromise is accepted. 
   
 - Since I decided to fix the size of pages to the block size of storage, whenever page has to be updated, 
   I hava a chance to collect defragmented area on memory and write the whole page on storage without any additional cost for storage access.
   
   hmmmm
